Pegasus: Sound continuous invariant generation
==============================================

Pegasus is a tool for generating continuous invariants for systems described by polynomial ordinary differential equations. It is integrated with the KeYmaera X theorem prover for hybrid systems and implements a number of methods for invariant generation. Pegasus provides a framework for combining techniques for invariant generation into more powerful strategies. Its ultimate purpose is to improve the level of proof automation in KeYmaera X and other deductive verification frameworks for hybrid systems.
