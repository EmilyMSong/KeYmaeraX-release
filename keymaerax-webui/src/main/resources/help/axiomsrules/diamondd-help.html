  <kbd>diamondd</kbd> turns a diamond modal formula <code>⟨a⟩P</code> equivalently into a double negated box modal formula <code>¬[a⟩¬P</code>.
  This is occasionally useful to convert between diamond and box modalities to make use of suitable proof rules that require a particular shape or side of the sequent.
