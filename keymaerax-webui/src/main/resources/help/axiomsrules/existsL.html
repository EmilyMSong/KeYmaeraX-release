  The <kbd>existsL</kbd> proof rule makes use of an existential assumption <code>∃x p(x)</code> by, instead, assuming that <code>p(y)</code> holds for some fresh variable <code>y</code> about which we don't know anything.
  After all, if we assume <code>∃x p(x)</code> then we know that <code>p(y)</code> holds for some <code>y</code> but we don't know which one.
