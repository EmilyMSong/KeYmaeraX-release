  <kbd>explore</kbd> runs the default automatic proof strategy of KeYmaera&#160;X until it proves,
    cannot make progress within the timeouts, or finds a counterexample.
  </p>
  <p>
  If it does not find a proof, the open branches indicate where automation stopped or found a counterexample.
  Then:

  <ol>
    <li>Scrutinize if you have all assumptions and correct controls for your model.</li>
    <li>Annotate loops and/or differential equations with appropriate <code>@invariant(...)</code> formulas.</li>
    <li>Click to continue the proof manually and either find a proof or how to bugfix your model.</li>
    <li>Exploit system insights to find an easier decomposition of your formula.</li>
    <li>Try other proof strategies or provide a domain-specific tactic performing proof search.</li>
  </ol>
