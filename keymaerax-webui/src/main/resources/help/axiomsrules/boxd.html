  <kbd>box</kbd> turns a box modal formula <code>[a]P</code> equivalently into a double negated diamond modal formula <code>¬⟨a⟩¬P</code>.
  This is occasionally useful to convert between box and diamond modalities to make use of suitable proof rules that require a particular shape or side of the sequent.
