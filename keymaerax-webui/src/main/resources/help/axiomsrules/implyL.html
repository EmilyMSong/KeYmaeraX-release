  The <kbd>implyL</kbd> proof rule uses an implication <code>P→Q</code> among its assumptions by first proving its left-hand side <code>P</code> and then, on a separate branch, assuming its right-hand side <code>Q</code>, which, according to the assumption <code>P→Q</code>, follows from <code>P</code>.
