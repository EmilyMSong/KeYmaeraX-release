  <kbd>choiced</kbd> splits a nondeterministic choice <code>a∪b</code> between running <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> into its alternatives by reducing it to a disjunction <code>[a]P ∨ [b]P</code> that establishes the liveness of <code>a</code> or of <code>b</code> separately.

Other tactics such as <kbd>chase</kbd> and <kbd>unfold</kbd> also use this axiom.
