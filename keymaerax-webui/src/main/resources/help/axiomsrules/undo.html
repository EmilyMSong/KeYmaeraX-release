    <b>Undo</b> the last proof step to try something else.
    Sometimes proof search can get into dead ends if you were trying to prove a formula in a way that did not ultimately succeed.
    Don't despair, simply undo proof steps and try again.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to undo multiple steps at a time, you can also <b>prune</b> a whole part of the proof.
    <ol>
      <li>Expand the proof by clicking a <i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i> sign</li>
      <li>Right-click on the rule name at a rule bar to open its context menu</li>
      <li>Select the <i class="fa fa-eraser"></i> <i>Prune</i> action</li>
    </ol>
