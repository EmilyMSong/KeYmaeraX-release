  <kbd>auto</kbd> is trying the default automatic proof strategy of KeYmaera&#160;X.

  <p>
  If it does not find a proof, then either your formula has a counterexample or <kbd>auto</kbd> just was unable to find a proof within the timeouts.
  Then:

  <ol>
    <li>Scrutinize if you have all assumptions and correct controls for your model.</li>
    <li>Annotate loops and/or differential equations with appropriate <code>@invariant(...)</code> formulas.</li>
    <li>Click to decompose the formula and either find a proof or how to bugfix your model.</li>
    <li>Exploit system insights to find an easier decomposition of your formula.</li>
    <li>Try other proof strategies or provide a domain-specific tactic performing proof search.</li>
  </ol>
