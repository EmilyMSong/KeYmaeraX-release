        ModelPlex derives verified runtime monitoring conditions from hybrid systems models that provide provable
        safety guarantees for unverified components, learned controllers, and can be used to measure safety robustness
        at runtime. At design time, ModelPlex monitoring conditions can be used to validate the model, e.g.,
        with simulations or recorded data.
