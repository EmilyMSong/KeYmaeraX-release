  The <kbd>hideR</kbd> weakening proof rule discards one available option <code>P</code> from the (disjunctive) succedent.
  You should hide irrelevant formulas whenever possible, because that can save a lot of computation time during the proof.<br/>
  Use <kbd>hideR</kbd> by clicking the closed-eye symbol <i class="fa fa-eye-slash"></i> next to a formula you hover over.
