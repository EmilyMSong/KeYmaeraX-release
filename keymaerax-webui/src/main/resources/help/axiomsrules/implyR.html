  The <kbd>implyR</kbd> proof rule proves an implication <code>P→Q</code> by assuming its left-hand side <code>P</code> (by pushing it into the assumptions in the antecedent) and proving its right-hand side <code>Q</code>.
  This exploits that the meaning of a sequent is implicational: (the conjunction of its) left-hand side implies (the disjunction of) its right-hand side.
