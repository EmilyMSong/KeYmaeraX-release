  The <kbd>loop</kbd> rule proves safety of a loop by a given loop invariant <code>J</code>, which:
  <ol>
    <li>initial case: needs to be true initially</li>
    <li>use case: needs to imply the postcondition <code>P</code></li>
    <li>induction step: is still true after one round of the loop whenever it was true before</li>
  </ol>
  When identifying loop invariants, it is important that it transports enough knowledge about how the state might have changed during past iterations of <code>a*</code>.
