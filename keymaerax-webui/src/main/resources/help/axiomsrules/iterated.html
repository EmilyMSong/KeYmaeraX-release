  <kbd>iterated</kbd> unwinds a loop once by rephrasing <code>&langle;a<sup>*</sup>&rangle;P</code> to the equivalent <code>Pâˆ¨&langle;a&rangle;&langle;a<sup>*</sup>&rangle;P</code>, which says that the loop achieves goal <code>P</code> if it holds initially already or after at least one repetition.
  Unwinding can be useful to reach states from which convergence proofs succeed (e.g., when being stopped, speed up for one loop iteration, then coast to the goal position).
