    <kbd>odeInvC</kbd> tactic proves <code>[{x'=f(x) & Q}]P</code> using <code>P</code> as an invariant of the ODE.
    The tactic is complete, i.e., it is guaranteed to succeed if <code>P</code> is indeed an invariant.
    However, it may be slow and complicated cases may benefit from other more dedicated proof rules to obtain faster proofs.
