  <kbd>diamondOr</kbd> splits a disjunctive postcondition <code>&langle;a&rangle;(P∨Q)</code> into two separate postconditions that can be considered separately <code>&langle;a&rangle;P ∨ &langle;a&rangle;Q</code> by using <kbd>andR</kbd>.
  This is an especially clever idea when <code>P</code> or <code>Q</code> hold for very different reasons after <code>a</code>, or only one of them holds.
