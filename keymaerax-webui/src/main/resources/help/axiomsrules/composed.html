      <kbd>composed</kbd> splits the sequential composition <code>a;b</code>, which runs <code>a</code> followed by <code>b</code>, into successive properties <code>&langle;a&rangle;&langle;b&rangle;P</code>.  This shows there is a un of <code>a</code> after which there is a run of <code>b</code> that satisfies <code>P</code> in the end.

Other tactics such as <kbd>chase</kbd> and <kbd>unfold</kbd> also use this axiom.
