      <kbd>composed</kbd> splits the liveness of a sequential composition <code>a;b</code>, which runs <code>a</code> followed by <code>b</code>, into successive liveness properties <code>&langle;a&rangle;&langle;b&rangle;P</code>.  This shows after a run of <code>a</code> it is the case that there is a run of <code>b</code> to satisfy <code>P</code>.

Other tactics such as <kbd>chase</kbd> and <kbd>unfold</kbd> also use this axiom.
