  <kbd>master</kbd> is trying the default automatic proof strategy of KeYmaera&#160;X.
  </p>
  <p>
  If <kbd>master</kbd> does not succeed, then either your formula has a counterexample or <kbd>master</kbd> just was unable to find a proof within the timeouts.

  <ol>
    <li>Sanity check if you have correct assumptions and controls for your model.</li>
    <li>Annotate loops and/or differential equations with <code>@invariant(...)</code> formulas.</li>
    <li>Click to decompose the formula and either find a proof or how to bugfix your model.</li>
    <li>Try other proof strategies or provide a domain-specific tactic performing proof search.</li>
