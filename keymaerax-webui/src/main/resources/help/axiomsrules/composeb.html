  <kbd>composeb</kbd> splits the safety of a sequential composition <code>a;b</code>, which runs <code>a</code> followed by <code>b</code>, into successive safety properties <code>[a][b]P</code>.  This shows after all runs of <code>a</code> it is the case that all runs of <code>b</code> are safe, so satisfy <code>P</code>.
</p>
<p>
Other tactics such as <kbd>chase</kbd> and <kbd>unfold</kbd> also use this axiom.

    <li><kbd>MR</kbd> monotonicity proves an intermediate condition holds after <code>a</code> and implies the safety of <code>b</code>.
      <kbd>MR</kbd> better separates proofs but requires an intermediate condition transporting all required knowledge through <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>.</li>
